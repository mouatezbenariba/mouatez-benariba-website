                As part of my personal blogging efforts, I embarked on a journey to share
                my knowledge, thoughts, and ideas with a wider audience. I created a blog
                to engage with like-minded individuals and build a community around topics
                that matter to me.

                Through this case study, I aim to showcase the challenges, solutions, and
                results of my efforts in building a successful personal blog, and to offer
                insights and recommendations for others looking to do the same.

                3. Design and User Interface
              </h1>
              <p>
                In designing my personal blog, my main focus was on creating a simple,
                intuitive user interface that would put the emphasis on the content. I
                opted for a minimalist design with a clean layout, using a muted color
                scheme and typography that would allow the articles to stand out.
              </p>
              <p>
                The header of the site contains links to my Arabic blog, all of the posts,
                and a link to my personal portfolio website. The main page features a
                welcome message, along with a photo and details about my current job
                position. The featured articles are prominently displayed on the homepage,
                with a focus on visual imagery to draw the reader in. In the footer, I
                included links to my social media accounts to encourage readers to connect
                with me and stay updated on my latest content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, my goal was to create a design that was easy to navigate and
                mobile-friendly, with a focus on the user experience and optimization for
                search engines.

                <h2 class="article-section__nested-heading fz-xs">a. Color scheme</h2>
                <p>
                  For the color scheme of my personal blog, I opted for a simple yet
                  visually pleasing palette that would complement the minimalist design.
                  The main colors used were purple, red, and bluish cyan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The body background color is a light shade of purple
                  <span class="bg-purple-100 color-code">#f5ebff</span>, which creates a
                  soft, calming effect and puts the focus on the content. The header and
                  footer background color is a deeper shade of purple
                  <span class="bg-purple-200 color-code">#dcc4ff</span>, which provides a
                  subtle contrast while still maintaining a cohesive look. I used a bright
                  <span class="bg-red-100 color-code">#e52424</span> red for tags in
                  article snippets, which stands out against the muted colors and draws
                  attention to the topic of the post. For tags in the tag list, I used a
                  darker shade of red <span class="bg-red-200 color-code">#7a1f1f</span>,
                  which provides a visual distinction between the different categories.
                  Finally, I used a bluish cyan
                  <span class="bg-blue-100 color-code">#2cccfb</span> for the next and
                  previous article links, as well as for hover effects on the footer links
                  and the article descriptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This color adds a touch of playfulness and helps to guide the reader's
                  attention to important elements on the page.

                <p>
                  For the typography of my personal blog, I chose the font-family
                  'CabinetGrotesk-Regular', which is a modern sans-serif font with clean
                  lines and a legible design. I opted for this font because it is easy to
                  read and pairs well with the minimalist design of the site. In order to
                  ensure consistency across all devices and browsers, I decided to
                  self-host the font using a web font service. This allowed me to have
                  more control over the font delivery and avoid any potential issues with
                  compatibility or loading times. Overall, the choice of font played an
                  important role in the overall look and feel of the site, and helped to
                  reinforce the minimalist and modern aesthetic.

                  a. Choice of Technology
                </h2>
                <p>
                  For the development of my personal blog, I chose to use Eleventy with
                  Nunjucks as the templating engine. This allowed me to take advantage of
                  Eleventy's powerful templating system, which made it easy to create
                  reusable components and layouts. By using Nunjucks, I was able to write
                  less code, resulting in a more efficient and performant website.
                  Additionally, I used and configured Netlify CMS to add blog posts, which
                  provided an intuitive and user-friendly content management system. With
                  Netlify CMS, I was able to quickly and easily add new blog posts, edit
                  existing content, and manage my site's structure. This streamlined my
                  content creation process, allowing me to focus on creating high-quality
                  content without getting bogged down in technical details. Overall, the
                  technology stack I chose allowed for efficient and streamlined
                  development, while also providing a robust platform for future expansion
                  and customization.

                  b. Website Structure
                </h2>
                <p>
                  For the website structure of my personal blog, I designed a simple and
                  intuitive layout that focused on the content. The base structure
                  consists of a header that includes a logo and links to the main page and
                  the navigation list, which includes links to the Arabic blog (/ar/), all
                  posts, and my portfolio. The footer includes links to my social media
                  accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main page is where visitors can find an introduction about me and
                  featured articles. The introduction provides a brief overview of who I
                  am and what I do, while the featured articles section highlights some of
                  my best and most popular blog posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The posts page contains all of the posts that I have written, listed in
                  chronological order (newest first). Visitors can browse the posts by
                  tags, making it easy to find articles on specific topics. This simple
                  and straightforward structure ensures that visitors can easily find the
                  content they're looking for and navigate the website with ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of my website structure, I also created a simple and
                  user-friendly 404 error page. This page displays a message letting
                  visitors know that the page they were looking for is not available and
                  provides them with options to return to the homepage or search for the
                  content they were looking for. The design of the page matches the
                  overall aesthetic of the website, ensuring a consistent and seamless
                  user experience. By providing a helpful and easy-to-use 404 error page,
                  I aimed to improve the overall user experience and make it easier for
                  visitors to navigate the website.

                <p>
                  Using a code standard is important for maintainability, readability, and
                  scalability of a project. In my project, I followed a few best practices
                  to ensure code consistency and maintainability:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    - I used Prettier to format my code, which helped to maintain a
                    consistent code style throughout the project.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    - I used CSS variables for colors, which allowed me to easily change
                    the color scheme of my website without having to search and replace
                    specific color values throughout my code.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    - I followed the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for my
                    CSS classes, which helped to keep my CSS organized and modular. This
                    naming convention also makes it easier to understand the relationship
                    between different elements on the page and to avoid naming conflicts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    - I made sure to comment my code when necessary, which helped me and
                    any other developers working on the project to understand the purpose
                    and functionality of different code sections.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    - I tested my code thoroughly to make sure it was functioning as
                    intended and to catch any potential bugs or errors before deployment.

              </h1>
              <p>
                My website achieved a perfect score of 100% on Google PageSpeed Insights
                for performance, SEO, and best practices on both mobile and desktop. This
                was due in part to my decision to build the website using Eleventy, which
                helped increase performance and keep the site minimalistic. Additionally,
                I optimized the website's page quality by deferring render-blocking
                JavaScript, specifically the Netlify CMS script and the Prism library used
                to style code blocks. By taking these steps, I was able to create a fast
                and high-performing website that provided an optimal user experience.

              <p>
                I implemented a key feature of my website, an Arabic version of my blog,
                to cater to a wider audience. To ensure consistency and ease of use, I
                made sure that the posts page only displays Arabic posts and the tags page
                only displays Arabic tags. This allowed my website to have a wider reach
                and provided a seamless experience for Arabic-speaking visitors.

              <p>
                For deployment, I chose to use Netlify, which made the process incredibly
                easy and efficient. After configuring my website and linking it to my
                Netlify account, I was able to deploy it to the subdomain
                blog.mouatezbenariba.me with just a few clicks. Netlify's continuous
                deployment feature ensured that my website was always up-to-date and
                automatically deployed any changes made to the repository. This allowed me
                to focus on creating content and making updates to the website without
                worrying about the deployment process. Overall, I found Netlify to be a
                reliable and user-friendly platform for deploying my Eleventy website.

                great choice for me. Its flexibility, simplicity, and performance allowed
                me to create a clean, efficient, and easily customizable website. I
                learned a lot throughout the development process, from working with
                Nunjucks templates and CSS variables to implementing Netlify CMS and Open
                Graph tags. By adhering to best practices, following a consistent code
                style, and keeping core web vitals in mind, I was able to create a
